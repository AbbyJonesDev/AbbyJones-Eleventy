## About this talk

Presentation from the [Coffee and Code](https://www.meetup.com/coffeeandcode/) meetup about my journey from special education teacher to software engineer.

After the presentation, I created a page to provide links to many of the resources I had mentioned in the talk. A link to that page is below.

This was the first iteration.  After this talk, [Women in Technology in the Heartland](http://witheartland.org/) invited me to give it again at their meeting in May.
