## About this talk

Presented at the [Omaha Elixir Mixer](https://www.meetup.com/omaha-elixir-mixer/) meetup in November 2022, this was a hands-on exploration of [Livebook](http://livebook.dev/) - Elixir's interactive, collaborative code notebook tool.  It highlights key features and looks at a variety of use cases to find out not just what Livebook can do, but where it can shine as part of our learning and engineering work flows.
