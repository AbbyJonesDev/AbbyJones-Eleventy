## About this talk

As Facebook and Twitter have dominated news headlines with a series of high-profile debacles, an international, grassroots movement has quietly been building momentum. The Federated Universe - or Fediverse - offers social media alternatives with an emphasis on privacy, transparency, open source code, and local control. Using the ActivityPub protocol as a unifying standard, these applications are able to communicate across separate “instances” and even across separate applications.

The Fediverse offers a new world of possibilities for both users and developers, and Elixir is a natural fit for this world. (Spoiler alert - Jose Valim is there!) 

Presented at the [Omaha Elixir Mixer](https://www.meetup.com/omaha-elixir-mixer/) meetup in May 2023, this talk explores what makes the Fediverse special, what makes it challenging, and where it might grow from here.
