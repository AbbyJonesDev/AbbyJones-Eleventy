## About this talk

Presentation from a combined meetup of [Women in Technology of the Heartland](http://witheartland.org/)(WITH) and the [Omaha Java User Group](http://ojug.org/)(OJUG) in May 2019 about my journey from special education teacher to software engineer.


This was the second iteration.  The first was at Coffee and Code in February 2019.
