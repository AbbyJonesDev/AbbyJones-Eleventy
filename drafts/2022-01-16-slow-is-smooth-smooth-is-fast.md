In March of 2020, I finally did something I've wanted to do for as long as I can remember.

I got an Australian Shepherd puppy.  

Her name is Maisie, and she is amazing.  She's everything I hoped she would be when I thought about getting a herding dog for so many years.  

Of course one of the reasons I waited so long is that I knew a herding dog would need lots of mental and physical exercise, and I didn't want to bring one home if I wasn't prepared to do right by it.  As I approached my 40th birthday, I decided I needed a dog who would make sure I didn't become a couch potato or spend too much time on my computer, and I was ready to make the commitment.  Suffice it to say that Maisie was more than willing to take on this job, and she is very good at it!  She also has an uncanny sense of when I've been scrolling social media on my phone too long, and she will step in to herd me away from it. She's quite the talented pup!

Over the past two years, I've learned a ton about dog training and the sport of agility.  Susan Garrett's [podcast](https://dogsthat.com/podcasts/) has had a huge impact on my thinking and my approach, and when I adopted a foster dog this fall, I signed up for her [Home School the Dog](https://dogsthat.com/home-school/) course.  The dogs learn faster than I do, but we're all enjoying the experience and building a better relationship along with our skills.

I was listening to a Facebook Live she did recently where she was talking about causes of dog injuries in agility, and she quoted one of her mentors, who said, "Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast."  One cause of injuries can be when people rush to work on speed without building a strong foundation where the dog knows how to complete the obstacles smoothly and safely.  If you watch the elite level agility competitions, sleek Border Collies racing around the course make it look effortless - but we don't see all of the practice sessions where they learned one obstacle at a time, and how to accelerate and deccelerate and collect their stride as they move from one to the next, and how to coordinate their front and back ends, and how to watch their person throughout the whole process so they know what to do next.

Maisie is super fast and super smart, but it didn't take long to realize that if I brought her onto even a mini course and urged her to race around it as fast as she could - we would both be a hot mess! We had no chance of completing the course correctly, and we would both be looking at each other and wondering, "What on earth are you doing???"

I'm thankful that dogs are so quick to forgive our mistakes and give us another try, and I'm excited by how far we've come as I've learned to slow down, break skills down into smaller pieces, and reward incremental progress.

**"Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast."**

In the software world, our tools and technologies continue to grow and change at an unrelenting pace, and the next critical feature is often needed yesterday.  How can we possibly slow down?

On the other hand - can we possibly afford not to?

I wonder....

* How much time do we spend fixing bugs that we introduced because we were moving too fast, or multi-tasking too much, or running on too much caffeine and not enough sleep?
* How much time do we spend re-working or rewriting software because we didn't take enough time upfront to understand the language or library or framework or tools we're using?
* How much time do we spend prematurely optimizing for the next feature before we know how the current one will work for users?
* How much extra time do we spend building new features because we haven't invested time in refactoring the existing code to make it more maintainable?

There has to be a balance, right?

If we wait until we fully know or fully understand it all - we'll never get started. There's a lot of learning that just doesn't happen until we're working on a real project and applying the "book learning" (blog learning, YouTube learning, etc) to a real problem.  There are requirements we'll never know exist until we get something in front of users and let them try it and tell us what we're missing. 

We can't come to a full stop, but if we want to move fast at a sustainable pace that keeps both the software and the people creating it healthy, we have to find ways to slow down, break things down, and become smooth.
