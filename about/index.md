## Professionally

I love building web sites and applications that are easy to use and look great on multiple devices.  It's fun to solve problems and help people accomplish their goals through technology.  

My experience includes full-stack web development on new and existing projects using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SASS, and WordPress.  I've worked with Python and tinkered a bit with Java and iOS development as well.  

I enjoy working from my home office (where my Shiba Inus can keep an eye on me) and collaborating with great people who help me sharpen my skills.
 
Though I can't read as fast as <a href="https://youtu.be/Pj-qBUWOYfE" target="__blank">Johnny 5</a>, I've always resonated with his insatiable need for input.  From musical instruments to sign language to programming - learning new things and then applying that knowledge is my way of life.  

My master's degree is in Special Education, and I have more than ten years of classroom experience teaching all subject areas.  Over the past two years, I've had several opportunities to combine my love for learning and teaching with my love for building with code. 

I was the Lead Instructor for [Omaha Code School: Highlander](http://highlander.omahacodeschool.com/) in the [Summer of 2015](http://highlander.omahacodeschool.com/summer-2015/), teaching front-end development to high school students.  In 2014, I worked with adult learners as a Teaching Assistant at [Omaha Code School](http://www.omahacodeschool.com/) and [Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/).  I've also been a mentor with [Omaha Coding Bliss](http://www.meetup.com/Coding-Bliss/) and a co-sponsor of the [Beveridge Magnet School](http://beveridge.ops.org/) Coding Club.

## Personally

Iâ€™m a big sister, dog lover, guitar player, writer, and all-around gadget nerd.

I grew up playing baseball in the backyard, basketball in the neighbor's driveway, and football in the street between our houses.  I read every mystery novel I could get my hands on, from Nancy Drew to Sherlock Holmes.  When I got old enough to babysit, I saved up my money to buy a Nintendo.  Super Mario Bros 3 was the first video game I ever won.

I still like playing catch and watching baseball and football, though I'm not sure what team I'll cheer for now that Peyton Manning has retired.  (*Omaha!*)  I'm happy that Nintendo is still around, that the Wii U is surviving against all odds, and that great new games are coming out for it.  I enjoy the PS4 too, but there's something relaxing and wonderful about Zelda, and both [Wind Waker](http://www.zelda.com/windwaker/) and [Twilight Princess](http://zelda.com/twilight-princess-hd/) are gorgeous in HD.    

I've been working on a mystery/baseball novel for awhile now.  It's called _Catch_, and it alternates between two story lines - one set in Vietnam during the war, and the other set in Nebraska in the early 80's.

There is _always_ a song stuck in my head. There is never enough time to do all the things I love - but the most important things are loving Jesus and loving people. And hanging out with my dogs, because they're awesome.
