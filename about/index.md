I became a teacher because I love to learn, and I love helping other people learn.  I taught for 12 years altogether, two as a high school English teacher and ten as a teacher of the deaf and hard of hearing.

Then I became a software developer because I love to learn, and I love creating things and seeing the things I created make a difference for someone.  Along the way, I get lots of opportunities to help other people learn, both at work and in the community.  And I get to work from home and hang out with my dogs.  It's a pretty great life.

I've given a couple of talks in the  community about how I made the transition from teaching to software development.  The slide decks are available in the [Talks](/talks/) section, and a list of resources I've found helpful are in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ry1-dvskjD0Gub5MaJc21M0_mp_4c0AuIOPdpBtHXSg).
