After a couple of rather frustrating experiences today, I wrote down some things I want to keep in mind whenever I'm working on a site. Nothing new or earth shattering, but these are some reminders to myself as a developer, from myself as a user.

* Use the lightest-weight tool that will do the job effectively. Some tools require frequent updates or take extra steps to render content. Don't make users do extra work or take extra time unless there's a good reason and a good payoff.

* Be sure your app works on all browsers without extra effort on the user's part. Don't make them hunt for a browser that's compatible with your app or wonder why your app works for other people but not for them.

* Get users where they want to go with the fewest number of clicks and redirects possible. Don't open a new page or window without a good reason. Balance this with creating a layout that's easy to navigate - not overly crowded with content or links.

* Content is king. Make content easy to read on any device - again, without extra work. Respect the user's time and let them know right away that they made a good decision when they hit your link.
