This week marks the beginning of an exciting new adventure - the maiden voyage of the <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/" target="_blank">Viking Code School</a>.  I had a fantastic experience as a TA with <a href="http://omahacodeschool.com/" target="_blank">Omaha Code School</a> last spring, and I'm excited to play that role again with a new group of students in a whole new format.

Viking Code School is an online program with students from across the country, but it's not like any program I've seen before.  Developed by <a href="http://www.eriktrautman.com/" target="_blank">Erik Trautman</a> of <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/home" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>, VCS brings together a small cohort of eight carefully selected students for a highly intensive, highly interactive bootcamp.

Instructors will be available to field questions via HipChat throughout the day as well as having daily teaching hours and group Q&amp;A sessions through video conferencing.  Students will use HipChat to help each other as they go through the readings and individual assignments; then they'll pair up with a new person each weekend to build a project together using video calls and screen sharing for remote pair programming.  We're gonna get to know each other <em>really</em> well over the next twelve weeks!

We had our kickoff session last night, and these students are amazing.  I'm a little intimidated, to be honest.  They are bright, dedicated, and passionate about building the web.  Each one has a unique background and brings different strengths and experience to the team.  I look forward to helping them in their journey, and I know I will learn a ton from them along the way.

Check out the <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/prep" target="_blank">prep work</a> they've already completed.  It's not for the faint of heart, but if you're curious about this whole web development thing, it's a great place to start.  Caution: contents are highly addictive.  You may even find yourself joining the Odin Project or applying for the next round of Viking Code School.
